# TypeScript Quiz App

A quiz application built to teach myself TypeScript. Utilizes the Open Trivia DB API for quiz information.

To use the app on your machine, clone this repo and run:

`npm install && npm start`

See some of what I've learned about TypeScript on my [Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/typescript-javascripts-more-responsible-cousin-58d1f045a7b2) page.
